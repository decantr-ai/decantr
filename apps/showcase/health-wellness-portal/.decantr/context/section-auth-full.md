# Section: auth-full

**Role:** gateway | **Shell:** centered | **Archetype:** auth-full
**Description:** Complete authentication flow with login, register, forgot password, reset password, email verification, and MFA setup/verify.

## Quick Start

**Shell:** Centered card on a background. Used for auth flows (login, register, forgot password) across all archetypes.
**Pages:** 8 (login, register, forgot-password, reset-password, verify-email, mfa-setup, mfa-verify, phone-verify)
**Key patterns:** form [complex]
**CSS classes:** `.health-nav`, `.health-card`, `.health-alert`
**Density:** comfortable
**Voice:** Caring, clear, and professional.

## Shell Implementation (centered)

### body

- **note:** Single centered card. No sidebar, no header. Auth forms use 28rem, wider content 36rem.
- **width:** 100%
- **padding:** 1.5rem
- **treatment:** d-surface
- **border_radius:** var(--d-radius-lg)
- **max_width_auth:** 28rem
- **max_width_wide:** 36rem

### root

- **align:** center
- **atoms:** _flex _center _minh[100vh]
- **display:** flex
- **justify:** center
- **background:** var(--d-bg)
- **min_height:** 100vh

### Anti-patterns

- Do NOT nest `overflow-y-auto` inside another `overflow-y-auto` — one scroll container per region.
- Do NOT apply `d-surface` to shell frame regions (sidebar, header). Use `var(--d-surface)` or `var(--d-bg)` directly.
- Do NOT add wrapper `<div>` elements around shell regions — the grid areas handle placement.

## Shell Notes (centered)

- **Max Width:** Centered content should be constrained to max-width: 28rem (448px) for auth forms, 36rem (576px) for wider content.
- **Vertical Centering:** Center the content card vertically using min-height: 100dvh with flexbox centering.

**Visual Treatments:** All 6 base treatments available (see DECANTR.md for usage).
**Theme decorators:**

| Class | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `.health-nav` | Clean spacious navigation with generous spacing. Clear active states and focus indicators. |
| `.health-card` | White card with subtle shadow and large 12px radius. Clean, spacious padding for medical content readability. |
| `.health-alert` | Left-border severity stripe (4px) with tinted background. Color indicates severity: info, warning, critical. |
| `.health-badge` | Rounded pill badge with tinted semantic background. Always includes text label for accessibility. |
| `.health-input` | Large input with generous 14px padding. Clear focus ring for accessibility. Designed for clinical data entry. |
| `.health-metric` | Large prominent number with color-coded status dot indicator. Used for vitals, lab results, and patient stats. |
| `.health-status` | Color-coded status with always-visible text label. Never relies on color alone per WCAG guidelines. |
| `.health-surface` | Warm white background with minimal 1px border. Creates gentle separation without harsh contrast. |

**Compositions:** **auth:** Centered authentication forms with clean card styling. HIPAA-compliant login with MFA support.
**clinical:** Clinical data entry and review. Dense but readable layouts with large inputs and clear labels.
**dashboard:** Patient dashboard with sidebar navigation. Vitals overview, appointments, medication schedule, and health metrics.
**marketing:** Healthcare marketing pages with trust signals. Professional hero sections and feature grids.
**patient-portal:** Patient-facing portal with top navigation. Simplified interface for appointments, records, and messaging.
**Spatial hints:** Density bias: -1. Section padding: 48px. Card wrapping: subtle.


Usage: `className={css('_flex _col _gap4') + ' d-surface healthcare-glass'}` — atoms via css(), treatments and theme decorators as plain class strings.

## Visual Direction

**Personality:** Calming, trust-building health portal with emphasis on clarity and accessibility. Soft blues and teals on warm white backgrounds. Large, readable typography — nothing small or dense. Vitals use color-coded status indicators always supplemented with text labels. Appointment booking is straightforward. Telehealth rooms are calm and functional. Document vault feels secure. Every interaction prioritizes patient confidence. Lucide icons. WCAG AAA compliance throughout.

**Personality utilities available in treatments.css:**
- `status-ring` with `data-status="active|idle|error|processing"` — Color-coded status with pulse animation

## Pattern Reference

### form

Structured form with labeled field groups, validation states, and action buttons

**Visual brief:** Well-organized form with clear field grouping under section headings. Each section has a heading in heading4 weight and a muted description line, followed by form fields arranged in a one- or two-column grid. Labels sit above their respective fields (stacked, never side-by-side) in small medium-weight text. Input fields use consistent height (~40px), rounded corners (r2), and border styling that brightens on focus with a primary-color ring. Select dropdowns match input styling with a custom chevron. Textareas have a taller minimum height (6rem). Required fields show a small asterisk. Validation errors display below the field in small destructive-red text. The form is constrained to 640px max-width for readability. Action buttons (Save, Cancel) sit at the bottom right, separated by a top border or spacing from the form fields.

**Components:** Card, Input, Select, Switch, Checkbox, Button, Label, Textarea, RadioGroup

**Composition:**
```
Form = Container(d-section, flex-col, gap-6, max-width) > [FormSection[] + ActionButtons]
Field = Stack(flex-col) > [Label(d-control, font-medium) + Input(d-control) + ValidationError?(d-annotation, text-destructive)]
FieldGroup = Grid > Field[]
FormSection = Card(d-surface) > [SectionTitle(heading4) + SectionDescription?(text-muted) + FieldGroup(d-control, grid: 1/2-col)]
ActionButtons = Row(d-interactive, gap-2) > [SaveButton(variant: primary) + CancelButton(variant: ghost)]
```

**Layout slots:**
- `actions`: Bottom-aligned save/cancel buttons
- `section`: Card with 2-column layout: labels left, fields right
- `field-group`: Grid of form fields with _grid _gc1 _lg:gc2 _gap4
- `section-title`: Section heading with _heading4 and description with _bodysm _fgmuted
  **Layout guidance:**
  - note: Labels go ABOVE their field, not side-by-side. This prevents the label-field gap problem at wide viewports.
  - textarea: Textareas should have min-height: 6rem to visually differentiate from single-line inputs.
  - max_width: Form content should be constrained to max-width: 40rem (640px). Full-width forms are hard to read.
  - icon_placement: Section header icons render INLINE with the heading text (icon left of heading, vertically centered), not floating outside the card border.
  - label_position: stacked
  - select_styling: Apply d-control to ALL form elements including <select>. Add appearance: none and a custom SVG chevron for consistent styling.
  - section_grouping: Group related fields under section headers. Use a SINGLE d-surface card for the entire form, OR no card at all. Do NOT wrap each section in its own separate card.
**Motion:**
| Interaction | Animation |
|-------------|-----------|
| error-shake | translateX(-4px, 4px, -2px, 2px, 0) 300ms ease-out on validation error |
| field-focus | border-color transition 150ms ease-out |
| button-press | scale(0.97) 100ms ease-out |
| success-submit | fade-out form + fade-in success message 300ms ease-out |
| validation-error | fade + slideDown 200ms ease-out for error message |

**Responsive:**
- **Mobile (<640px):** Single column for all field groups. Fields go full-width. Action buttons stack vertically at full width, primary on top. Section headings go full-width above fields. Padding reduces to p3.
- **Tablet (640-1024px):** Two-column field grid activates for shorter fields (name, email). Textareas span full width. Action buttons stay horizontal, right-aligned.
- **Desktop (>1024px):** Full two-column grid for field groups. Settings preset shows section label column on the left, fields on the right. Generous p4 spacing. Inline validation visible without layout shift.

**Accessibility:**
- Role: `form`
- Keyboard: Tab navigates between fields; Shift+Tab navigates backwards between fields; Enter submits when focus is on submit button; Escape cancels or closes modal forms; Arrow keys navigate within radio groups; Space toggles checkboxes and switches
- Announcements: Validation errors announced on field blur; Required field indicator announced on focus; Success confirmation announced on submit; Field group label announced on section entry
- Focus: First invalid field receives focus on failed validation. On successful submit, focus moves to success message or next logical action.
