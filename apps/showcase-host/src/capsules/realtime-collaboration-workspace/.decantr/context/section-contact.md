# Section: contact

**Role:** public | **Shell:** top-nav-footer | **Archetype:** contact
**Description:** Contact page with hero header and working contact form with validation and spam protection.

## Quick Start

**Shell:** Horizontal nav with main content and a persistent footer. Used for marketing sites, documentation with ToC footer. (header: 52px)
**Pages:** 1 (contact)
**Key patterns:** hero, form [complex]
**CSS classes:** `.paper-card`, `.paper-fade`, `.paper-input`
**Density:** comfortable
**Voice:** Warm, collaborative, and productivity-focused.

## Shell Implementation (top-nav-footer)

### body

- **flex:** 1
- **note:** Full-width sections stack vertically. Each section uses d-section with --d-section-py. Body has NO padding — sections own their spacing. Natural document scroll.
- **padding:** none

### root

- **atoms:** _flex _col _minh[100vh]
- **display:** flex
- **direction:** column
- **min_height:** 100vh

### footer

- **note:** Multi-column footer with link groups and legal.
- **border:** top
- **padding:** 2rem 1.5rem
- **position_within:** bottom (mt-auto for short pages)

### header

- **align:** center
- **border:** bottom
- **height:** 52px
- **sticky:** true
- **display:** flex
- **justify:** space-between
- **padding:** 0 1.5rem
- **z_index:** 10
- **background:** var(--d-bg)
- **left_content:** Brand/logo
- **button_sizing:** Buttons in the header use compact sizing: py-1.5 px-3 text-sm (~32px tall). The header is a tight 52px bar — default d-interactive padding is too large here.
- **right_content:** CTA button + mobile hamburger. Hamburger ONLY below md breakpoint.
- **center_content:** Nav links — flex with gap 1.5rem. Hidden below md, visible above.

### Anti-patterns

- Do NOT nest `overflow-y-auto` inside another `overflow-y-auto` — one scroll container per region.
- Do NOT apply `d-surface` to shell frame regions (sidebar, header). Use `var(--d-surface)` or `var(--d-bg)` directly.
- Do NOT add wrapper `<div>` elements around shell regions — the grid areas handle placement.

## Shell Notes (top-nav-footer)

- **Cta Sections:** CTA sections at the bottom of marketing pages should stand out visually — subtle background gradient or glass effect, not just a plain card.
- **Section Labels:** Section overline labels (CAPABILITIES, HOW IT WORKS) should be uppercase, small, accent-colored, center-aligned, with letter-spacing: 0.1em. Use d-label class with text-align: center.
- **Section Spacing:** Marketing sections use spacious density. Each d-section uses full --d-section-py padding.

## Spacing Guide

## Visual Direction

**Personality:** Warm, distraction-free collaboration workspace built for focused teamwork. Light paper-like backgrounds with comfortable reading typography. Presence indicators use distinct warm colors per collaborator. Inline comments appear as subtle margin annotations. Page tree navigation is clean and collapsible. The document editor prioritizes content over chrome — toolbar hides on scroll, formatting is keyboard-first. Real-time cursors and selections feel natural, not distracting. Think Notion meets Google Docs — productive, polished, and genuinely collaborative.

## Pattern Reference

### hero

Full-width hero with headline, subtext, CTA buttons, and optional media. Entry point for landing pages, recipe detail headers, and marketing sections.

**Visual brief:** Full-width section dominating the viewport with a bold, large-scale headline centered or left-aligned depending on preset. Generous vertical padding (4-6rem top/bottom) creates breathing room. Subtext sits beneath the headline in muted, lighter-weight type with relaxed line-height. One or two CTA buttons are arranged horizontally with equal height — the primary filled, the secondary ghost-outlined. Optional media (illustration, screenshot, or ambient gradient) appears below or beside the content. Brand preset fills the entire viewport height with decorative floating orbs in the background. Split preset uses a two-column grid with content on one side and media on the other.

**Components:** Button, icon

**Layout slots:**
- `media`: Optional image, illustration, or chart component
- `headline`: Primary heading, typically h1 with _heading1
- `cta-group`: Horizontal Button group with _flex _gap3
- `description`: Supporting paragraph with _body _muted
  **Layout guidance:**
  - note: Hero sections should NOT wrap content in d-surface cards. The hero IS the section. Use d-section for spacing.
  - subtitle: Subtitle line-height should be 1.6-1.8. Use text-muted color, smaller font than heading.
  - container: none
  - background: Hero sections should have a subtle radial or mesh gradient background using the theme palette — not a flat color. Use the primary and accent colors at very low opacity (5-10%) to create depth. Example: radial-gradient(ellipse at top center, rgba(var(--d-accent-rgb), 0.08) 0%, transparent 60%), or a soft gradient from primary to transparent. The gradient should fade to var(--d-bg) at the edges so it blends seamlessly with the page.
  - cta_sizing: Primary and secondary CTAs should have equal padding and height. Primary is filled (d-interactive[data-variant=primary]), secondary is ghost (d-interactive[data-variant=ghost]).
  - ambient_glow: For themes with neon/glow personality, add a soft ambient glow behind the hero heading or CTA area. Use a blurred pseudo-element or box-shadow with the accent color at 10-15% opacity, radius 200-400px. This creates a focal point without overwhelming the content.
  - announcement: If showing an announcement badge above the heading, use d-annotation with prominent styling — not a tiny muted pill. Accent border or accent background at 15% opacity.
  - visual_proof: The visual element below CTAs should be an ambient visualization (animated gradient, particle effect, blurred screenshot) — NOT a data widget wrapped in a card. If showing product data (agents, metrics), render as floating elements without card containment. Omit entirely if no meaningful visual is available.
**Motion:**
| Interaction | Animation |
|-------------|-----------|
| micro | CTA buttons scale subtly on hover (scale 1.02). Badge shimmer on announcement pill. |
| transitions | Hero entrance: headline fades up from 20px below with 600ms ease-out. Subtext follows 150ms later. CTAs follow 300ms after subtext. Decorative orbs drift slowly with infinite CSS animation. Brand preset media floats with gentle vertical oscillation. |

**Responsive:**
- **Mobile (<640px):** Single column, stacked vertically. Headline drops to heading2 scale. CTAs stack full-width. Padding reduces to py8 px4. Media goes below content at full width. Min-height removed on brand/vision presets.
- **Tablet (640-1024px):** Content remains centered or stacked. Headline at heading1 scale. CTAs stay horizontal. Split preset still single-column. Padding at py12 px6.
- **Desktop (>1024px):** Full layout as designed — centered or split two-column. Headline at display scale for brand/vision. Generous py16-py24 padding. Split preset activates side-by-side grid. Decorative elements visible.

**Accessibility:**
- Role: `banner`
- Keyboard: Tab to CTA button; Enter activates CTA
- Announcements: Page title announced on load
- Focus: CTA button is the primary focus target


### form

Structured form with labeled field groups, validation states, and action buttons

**Visual brief:** Well-organized form with clear field grouping under section headings. Each section has a heading in heading4 weight and a muted description line, followed by form fields arranged in a one- or two-column grid. Labels sit above their respective fields (stacked, never side-by-side) in small medium-weight text. Input fields use consistent height (~40px), rounded corners (r2), and border styling that brightens on focus with a primary-color ring. Select dropdowns match input styling with a custom chevron. Textareas have a taller minimum height (6rem). Required fields show a small asterisk. Validation errors display below the field in small destructive-red text. The form is constrained to 640px max-width for readability. Action buttons (Save, Cancel) sit at the bottom right, separated by a top border or spacing from the form fields.

**Components:** Card, Input, Select, Switch, Checkbox, Button, Label, Textarea, RadioGroup

**Composition:**
```
Form = Container(d-section, flex-col, gap-6, max-width) > [FormSection[] + ActionButtons]
Field = Stack(flex-col) > [Label(d-control, font-medium) + Input(d-control) + ValidationError?(d-annotation, text-destructive)]
FieldGroup = Grid > Field[]
FormSection = Card(d-surface) > [SectionTitle(heading4) + SectionDescription?(text-muted) + FieldGroup(d-control, grid: 1/2-col)]
ActionButtons = Row(d-interactive, gap-2) > [SaveButton(variant: primary) + CancelButton(variant: ghost)]
```

**Layout slots:**
- `actions`: Bottom-aligned save/cancel buttons
- `section`: Card with 2-column layout: labels left, fields right
- `field-group`: Grid of form fields with _grid _gc1 _lg:gc2 _gap4
- `section-title`: Section heading with _heading4 and description with _bodysm _fgmuted
  **Layout guidance:**
  - note: Labels go ABOVE their field, not side-by-side. This prevents the label-field gap problem at wide viewports.
  - textarea: Textareas should have min-height: 6rem to visually differentiate from single-line inputs.
  - max_width: Form content should be constrained to max-width: 40rem (640px). Full-width forms are hard to read.
  - icon_placement: Section header icons render INLINE with the heading text (icon left of heading, vertically centered), not floating outside the card border.
  - label_position: stacked
  - select_styling: Apply d-control to ALL form elements including <select>. Add appearance: none and a custom SVG chevron for consistent styling.
  - section_grouping: Group related fields under section headers. Use a SINGLE d-surface card for the entire form, OR no card at all. Do NOT wrap each section in its own separate card.
**Motion:**
| Interaction | Animation |
|-------------|-----------|
| error-shake | translateX(-4px, 4px, -2px, 2px, 0) 300ms ease-out on validation error |
| field-focus | border-color transition 150ms ease-out |
| button-press | scale(0.97) 100ms ease-out |
| success-submit | fade-out form + fade-in success message 300ms ease-out |
| validation-error | fade + slideDown 200ms ease-out for error message |

**Responsive:**
- **Mobile (<640px):** Single column for all field groups. Fields go full-width. Action buttons stack vertically at full width, primary on top. Section headings go full-width above fields. Padding reduces to p3.
- **Tablet (640-1024px):** Two-column field grid activates for shorter fields (name, email). Textareas span full width. Action buttons stay horizontal, right-aligned.
- **Desktop (>1024px):** Full two-column grid for field groups. Settings preset shows section label column on the left, fields on the right. Generous p4 spacing. Inline validation visible without layout shift.

**Accessibility:**
- Role: `form`
- Keyboard: Tab navigates between fields; Shift+Tab navigates backwards between fields; Enter submits when focus is on submit button; Escape cancels or closes modal forms; Arrow keys navigate within radio groups; Space toggles checkboxes and switches
- Announcements: Validation errors announced on field blur; Required field indicator announced on focus; Success confirmation announced on submit; Field group label announced on section entry
- Focus: First invalid field receives focus on failed validation. On successful submit, focus moves to success message or next logical action.
