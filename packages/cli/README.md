# @decantr/cli

Support status: `core-supported`  
Release channel: `stable`

Decantr’s main local operator surface for scaffolding, auditing, inspecting, and maintaining Decantr projects.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @decantr/cli
```

Or run it without installing:

```bash
npx @decantr/cli init --blueprint=agent-marketplace --yes
```

## What It Does

- scaffolds Decantr projects from blueprints, archetypes, or prompts
- generates execution-pack context files for AI coding assistants
- audits projects against Decantr contracts
- searches the registry and showcase benchmark corpus
- validates, refreshes, and maintains `decantr.essence.json`

## Common Commands

```bash
decantr init --blueprint=agent-marketplace
decantr magic "AI-native analytics workspace"
decantr audit
decantr check
decantr registry summary --namespace @official --json
decantr showcase verification --json
```

## Generated Context

Scaffolded projects include compiled execution packs under `.decantr/context/`, including:

- `scaffold-pack.md` / `scaffold-pack.json`
- `section-*-pack.md` / `section-*-pack.json`
- `page-*-pack.md` / `page-*-pack.json`
- `review-pack.md` / `review-pack.json`
- `pack-manifest.json`

Those files are the compact task contracts meant for AI assistants and downstream tooling.

Recommended read order for AI-assisted scaffolding:

1. `DECANTR.md` for the design spec, CSS approach, and guard rules
2. `.decantr/context/scaffold-pack.md` as the primary compiled shell, theme, feature, and route contract
3. `.decantr/context/scaffold.md` as the broader app overview and topology guide
4. matching `section-*-pack.md` and `section-*.md` files before section work
5. matching `page-*-pack.md` files before route work

Treat the compiled execution packs as the source of truth. Use the narrative docs as secondary explanation, start with the shell and route structure first, and run `decantr check` plus `decantr audit` after implementation.
